# RPI PI Pico Bare bones

*...without Pico SDK*
<br>
***...without C stdlib***

### Why

- Because my 'tistic brain wanted to do so. No SDKs, just RP2040 and W25Q16JV docs.
- Because it's fun
- I have... plans with this thing ;)

### Current features:

- ~Not~ Working QSPI Flash :D
- LED blink
- ...

### Current goals (might change over time):

- Custom (working) stage 2 bootloader
- Basic scheduler (for now)
- Serial interface
- Some form of a executable format
- Simple, minimal kernel for syscalls
- Memory manager
- Semi-custom stdlib (malloc, free, printf, scanf...)
